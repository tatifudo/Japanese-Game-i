You have a train ticket, but you still need to pay for it. You go up to the window and they say the price of the ticket is 2500 yen. You only have dollars so you need to use your knowledge of Japanese and American money to be able to carry on. There are two rooms, one to the east of you and one to the north. Above the east door it says train rides costing 2.50 dollars, and on above the north door it says train rides costing 25 dollars. The correct conversion will lead you to the correct train. Before you go you decide to pick up the shiny thing in the corner of the room that caught your eye.

You have a train ticket, but you still need to pay for it. You go up to the window and they say the price of the ticket is 2500 yen. You only have dollars so you need to use your knowledge of Japanese and American money to be able to carry on. There are two rooms, one to the east of you and one to the north. Above the east door it says train rides costing 2.50 dollars, and on above the north door it says train rides costing 25 dollars. The correct conversion will lead you to the correct train. Before you go you decide to pick up the shiny thing in the corner of the room that caught your eye.

Wow its very pretty, you should write a letter to your family to tell them how pretty it is. You see two mailboxes. One mailbox shows you a picture of mail where the letters are written vertically.

You onyl have dollars so You need to use your knowledge of Japanese and American money to be able to carry on. There are two windows, on to the east of your and one to the north. Above the east door it says train rides costing 2.50 dollars, and on above the north door it says train rides costing 25 dollars. The correct conversion will lead you onto the road so you can safely make it onto your train. Before you go you decide to pick up the shiny thing in the corner of the roomt hat caught your eye.
